This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 


Install packages for simulation and set.seed for reproducibility
```{r}
install.packages("runjags", dependencies = TRUE, repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
install.packages("MCMCpack", dependencies = TRUE, repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("R2jags")
library(R2jags)
install.packages("coda")
library(coda)
install.packages("mcmcplots")
library(mcmcplots)
library(dplyr)
library(xtable)
```

Load data and clean up dataframe to columns being utlized. 
```{r}
EPL_2018 <- read_csv('E0.csv')

EPL_2018_2 <- transmute(EPL_2018, dt=as.Date(Date, format="%d/%m/%y"),dt, HomeTeam, Home=TRUE,  AwayTeam, GoalsFor=FTHG, GoalsAgainst=FTAG,  Match_Result=sign(GoalsFor-GoalsAgainst), FTR, HS, AS, HST, AST, B365H, B365D, B365A)
```

Creating a dataframe EPL_Clean with only complete match results 
Omitting any NAs

```{r}
EPL_Clean <- na.omit(EPL_2018_2)

teams <- unique(c(EPL_Clean$HomeTeam, EPL_Clean$AwayTeam))
season_date <- unique(EPL_Clean$dt)
```

A list for JAGS with the data from EPL Clean where the strings are coded as integers 
```{r}
data_list <- list(GoalsFor = EPL_Clean$GoalsFor, GoalsAgainst = EPL_Clean$GoalsAgainst, 
                  HomeTeam = as.numeric(factor(EPL_Clean$HomeTeam, levels=teams)),
                  AwayTeam = as.numeric(factor(EPL_Clean$AwayTeam, levels=teams)),
                  Season = as.numeric(factor(EPL_Clean$dt, levels=season_date)),
                  n_teams = length(teams), n_games = nrow(dt), 
                  n_seasons = length(dt))
```
Convenience function to generate the type of column names Jags outputs.

```{r}
col_name <- function(name, ...) {
  paste0(name, "[", paste(..., sep=",") , "]")}
```

Modeling Match Results: iteration 1 


The distribution of number of goals for each team in EPL
Given the assumption that all game matches are roughly equally long, that both teams have many chances at making a goal and that each team have the same probability of making a goal each goal chance. Given these assumptions the distribution of the number of goals for each team should be well captured by a Poisson distribution. A quick comparison between the actual distribution of the number of scored goals and a Poisson distribution having the same mean number of scored goals support this notion
```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
old_par <- par(mfcol=c(2,1), mar=rep(2.2, 4))
hist(c(EPL_Clean$GoalsAgainst, EPL_Clean$GoalsFor), xlim=c(-0.5, 8), breaks = -1:9 + 0.5)

mean_goals <- mean(c(EPL_Clean$GoalsAgainst, EPL_Clean$GoalsFor))
hist(rpois(9999, mean_goals), xlim=c(-0.5, 8), breaks = -1:9 + 0.5)
par(old_par)


```


```{r tidy=FALSE}
m1_string <- "model {
for(i in 1:n_games) {
  GoalsFor[i] ~ dpois(lambda_home[HomeTeam[i],AwayTeam[i]])
  GoalsAgainst[i] ~ dpois(lambda_away[HomeTeam[i],AwayTeam[i]])
}

for(home_i in 1:n_teams) {
  for(away_i in 1:n_teams) {
    lambda_home[home_i, away_i] <- exp(baseline + skill[home_i] - skill[away_i])
    lambda_away[home_i, away_i] <- exp(baseline + skill[away_i] - skill[home_i])
  }
}

skill[1] <- 0
for(j in 2:n_teams) {
  skill[j] ~ dnorm(group_skill, group_tau)
}  

group_skill ~ dnorm(0, 0.0625)
group_tau <- 1 / pow(group_sigma, 2)
group_sigma ~ dunif(0, 3)
baseline ~ dnorm(0, 0.0625)
}"

```


```{r}
# Compiling model 1
m1 <- jags.model(textConnection(m1_string), data=data_list, n.chains=3, n.adapt=5000)

# Burning some samples on the altar of the MCMC god
update(m1, 5000)

# Generating MCMC samples
s1 <- coda.samples(m1, variable.names=c("baseline", "skill", "group_skill", "group_sigma"), n.iter=10000, thin=2)

# Merging the three MCMC chains into one matrix
ms1 <- as.matrix(s1)
